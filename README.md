# Anime folio

## Why?
Personal project born out of my love for anime and frustration with forgetting details of the series I enjoy. I've experienced the annoyance of losing track of where I left off in a series or forgetting the names and storylines of anime I've watched. That's why I've created this tracker with features fits to my needs.
 
## Plan 

1. **Listing Favorites:** Keep a comprehensive list of my favorite anime series.
2. **Detailed Entries:** Input detailed information about each anime, including name, tags, completion status, current season, and total seasons.
3. **Easy Access:** Access a dedicated page listing all my favorite anime for quick reference.
4. **Comprehensive Details:** View detailed pages for each anime, allowing me to upload clips, wallpapers, or memorable dialogue.
5. **Personalized Recommendations:** Utilize filters to receive tailored suggestions based on my preferences.
6. **Rating System:** Rate each anime for personal reference and recommendations.
7. **Custom Tags and Categories:** Organize my anime list with custom tags or categories based on my unique preferences.
8. **Personal Notes:** Add personal notes to remember important plot points, characters, or episodes.
9. **Progress Tracking:** Keep track of my overall progress for each anime series, including episode counts or completion percentages.
10. **Convenient Navigation:** Incorporate keyboard shortcuts for effortless navigation within the website (Optional).
11. **Anime Glossary:** Explore a dedicated page explaining the meaning of anime-related words to enhance my understanding of genres and terminology.
